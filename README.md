# Ansible-Practice

Run command "ansible-playbook playbook.yml" 

it will run docker container by pulling image from my docker registry on port 8000 

go to browser and paste the your host-machine/EC2 instance public ip address with port 8000 Ex: <public ip>:8000 

you will see the webpage that means our application has been deployed on the docker container.
